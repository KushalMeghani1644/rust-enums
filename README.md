# Rust: Enums and Pattern Matching

This project demonstrates core Rust concepts like custom `enum` types, pattern matching with `match`, and struct composition.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- **Custom enums** with data:
  - `IpAddr::V4` and `IpAddr::V6`
  - `Message` with different variants
- **Pattern matching** on enums
- **Method implementation** using `impl` for enums
- Struct composition using enums as fields

This code isn't vibe coded and AI was used for assistance to get rid of warnings in the code :D
